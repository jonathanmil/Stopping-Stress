	  	 	My number one method to reducing stress during these times is working out. With gym's closing I have learned to use everyday objects to workout and burnoff steam. When I am angry I do pushups and I do pullups at the bar at my home. This is a very inconveniant thing for me however with these challenging times it is something that needs to be done. Working out both releases anger and also makes me stronger. I have always wanted to be stronger and working out is a clear example of how I am able to achieve this goal.

	   	A clear example of something that I use everyday in order to reduce is running up and down the stairs. Without being able to go outside this simple type of cardio is something I have started using everyday. It is far more useful then ever expected and I continute to use it.
